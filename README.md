All your favorite Puntalytics code, now in package form.  
  
You can install via:

If you're used to using [nflfastR](https://github.com/mrcaseb/nflfastR), the data format should look familiar; if not, be sure to check it out.  Big thanks to them and their predecessors at nflscrapR for all of their hard work compiling these datasets.  
  
In lieu of real documentation, there's some additonal information about the package on our [website](https://puntalytics.github.io)
