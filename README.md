# puntr

Welcome to the documentation for `puntr`, an R package for puntalytics! Check out the [get started](https://puntalytics.github.io/puntr/articles/puntr.html) page for the basics.  
  
This package was designed by the folks behind [Puntalytics](https://twitter.com/ThePuntRunts) on twitter; if you're intested in analysis of punting, be sure to check it out. We also have a [website](https://puntalytics.github.io/) with some more verbose examples of our work, and we've contributed to [Open Source Football](https://www.opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-08-21-rerun-exonerating-punters-for-large-returns/).  
  
Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions, concerns, or suggestions via twitter dm, or on github.
